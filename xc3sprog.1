.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xc3sprog
is a command-line tool for programming FPGAs, microcontrollers and PROMs via JTAG.

In a typical application, \fBxc3sprog\fR reads a .BIT file generated by an
FPGA design tool, and programs it into the PROM chip on an FPGA board for
persistent storage or the configuration RAM of a FPGA for temporary storage.
For other use cases, see the section \fBEXAMPLES\fR below.

As its name indicates, \fBxc3sprog\fR was originally designed for Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGAs.
However, it has been extended to handle several other types of devices
including Xilinx FPGAs, CPLDs, XCF flash PROMs, Atmel AVRs and SPI flash chips.
\fBxc3sprog\fR supports several JTAG cables, including parallel port cables and USB programmers.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcable\fR
Specify the type of JTAG cable.
The specified type, \fIcable\fR refers to a label in the cable database.
.br
Common cable types are \fBpp\fR (parallel port cable),
\fBxpc\fR (Xilinx USB programmer), and
\fBftdi\fR (FTDI-based USB programmer).

.TP
.B \-j
Detect the JTAG chain and print a list of attached devices.
This is the default if no other action is specified.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIval\fR[,\fIval\fR,...]
Use device at JTAG chain position \fIval\fR, default is position 0,
the device connected to the TDO pin of the JTAG cable.
Use this option to select a device from a multi-device JTAG chain.

If multiple chain positions are specified, the data file will be split,
programming the first part of the file into the first specified device
and so on. This is useful for boards which a chain of multiple XCF chips to
configure a single FPGA.

.TP
\fB\-T\fR\fIn\fR
Test the JTAG chain \fIn\fR times.
When running in ISF mode, test the SPI connection.
.br
If \fIn\fR is not specified, the default is to test 10000 times.
.br
If \fIn\fR = 0, keep testing forever.

.TP
\fB\-J\fR \fIfreq\fR
Run at the specified JTAG clock frequency (\fIfreq\fR in Hz).
If not specified, or if \fIfreq\fR = 0, the default is to run at the
maximum frequency supported by the cable.
.br
Currently only supported for FTDI-based cables.

.TP
.B \-e
Erase the entire device.

.TP
\fB\-I\fR[\fIfile\fR]
Work in ISF mode to program an internal serial flash memory.
The flash memory is attached to the primary JTAG target, but not directly
accessible via the JTAG chain.
The primary JTAG target is used as a proxy to forward SPI transactions
to the flash memory.
If \fIfile\fR is specified, start by programming the specified bitfile into
the primary JTAG target (typically an FPGA).

.TP
.B \-R
Send a reconfiguration command to the target device (XCV, XCF, XCFP for
reconfiguration of the connected FPGA device or XC3S, XC6S, XC2V direct)

.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fImapdir\fR
Search for XC2C map files in the specified directory.
Map files are required to handle JEDEC files during CPLD programming.
If not specified, defaults to the value of \fB$XC_MAPDIR\fR.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fI/dev/parportN\fR
Specify the parallel port device to be used.
If not specified, defaults to the value of \fB$XCPORT\fR or \fI/dev/parport0\fR.
.br
Only used for cable type \fBpp\fR.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIserialnum\fR
Use the USB device with the specified serial number string. Needed if
several adapters of the same type are connected at the same time.

.TP
.B \-L
Use libFTD2XX instead of libftdi to access FTDI-based cables.

.TP
.B \-D
Dump the device database and cable database to files \fIdevlist.txt\fR and
\fIcablelist.txt\fR in the current directory. If a file already exists,
xc3sprog tries to generate a unique name by appending an increasing number.

.TP
\fB\-X\fR \fIopt\fR[,\fIopt\fR...]
Set configuration mode for XCFnnP PROM devices. Configuration from
XCFnnP PROM may be done in several modes, depending on the wiring between
XCFnnP and FPGA. By default, xc3sprog prepares XCFnnP devices for
slave serial mode (FPGA running in master serial mode).

To override the defaults, specify a comma-separated list of options.
The following options are accepted:
.br
.TS
tab (@);
l l.
\fBmaster\fR@XCFnnP is master (FPGA is slave)
\fBslave\fR@XCFnnP is slave (FPGA is master, this is default)
\fBparallel\fR@Parallel configuration data bus
\fBserial\fR@Serial configuration data line (default)
\fBextclk\fR@Use external clock in master mode
\fBintclk\fR@Use internal clock in master mode
\fBfastclk\fR@Use fast internal clock
\fBslowclk\fR@Use slow internal clock
.TE

.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose output.

.TP
.B \-h
Print a help text.

.SH "ACTION SPECIFICATION"

One or more programming actions may be specified.
Each action consists of a filename, optionally followed by attributes
in the form
<\fIfilename\fR:\fIaction\fR:\fIoffset\fR:\fIstyle\fR:\fIlength\fR>.

.TP 4
.I filename
The file to be written to the device, or the file in which to store
data after reading from the device.

.TP
.I action
One letter indicating whether to write, read, or verify the device.
If not specified, the default action is 'w'.
.TS
tab (@);
l l.
w@Erase, then write data from file to device and verify.
W@Write with auto-sector erase, then verify.
v@Verify device against file.
r@Read from device and write to file (no overwriting).
R@Read from device and write to file, overwriting existing files.
.TE

.TP
.I offset
The byte offset inside the device where programming/reading should start.
Only supported for SPI, XCFnnS devices and XMEGA.

.TP
.I style
The format of the specified file.

.TS
tab (@);
l lw(56).
BIT@T{
Xilinx \.BIT file format.
Default for FPGA, XCF and SPI devices.
T}
BIN@Raw binary file.
MCS@Xilinx .MCS file format.
IHEX@T{
Intel HEX format.
Also used by Xilinx PROMGEN when writing MCS files.
Default for XMEGA devices.
T}
HEXRAW@Raw sequence of hexadecimal digits.
JEDEC@Default for CPLD devices.
.TE

.TP
.I length
The number of bytes to program/read.
Only supported for SPI, XCFnnS and XMEGA devices.

.SH "DEVICE DATABASE"

The device database contains a list of supported JTAG devices.
When \fBxc3sprog\fR starts, it scans the JTAG chain to discover
all attached devices.
A device database is used to map the 32-bit ID codes of the devices
to descriptive names and get basic knowledge how to handle the part, at
minimum how to skip it. 

A default device database is compiled into the \fBxc3sprog\fR executable.
The database is tried to be loaded from a file at run time.  If the
environment variable \fB$XCDB\fR is defined, it specifies the name of the
device database file, otherwise the file \fIdevlist.txt\fR is read from the
current directory.  If a database file is not found at all, the internal
compile-time database will be used.

If a device is not yet know, the builtin list can be dumped, the information
on the unknown part added and on the next run the new list will be read and used.

.SH "CABLE DATABASE"

The cable database contains a list of supported JTAG cables.
Each cable type is identified by a short label,
such as \fBpp\fR, \fBftdijtag\fR, or \fBxpc\fR.
The database maps the label to parameters to be used to access the hardware
of the cable.

A default cable database is compiled into the \fBxc3sprog\fR executable.
The database is tried to be loaded from a file at run time.  If the
environment variable \fB$CABLEDB\fR is defined, it specifies the name of the
cable database file, otherwise the file \fIcablelist.txt\fR is read from the
current directory.  If a database file is not found at all, the internal
compile-time database will be used.

If a cable subtype (e.g. different VID/PID) is not yet know, the builtin
list can be dumped, the information on the new cable added and on the next
run the new list will be read and used.

The database contains a line for each nown cable. The line consists of the
alias for that cable to used with the \-c option, the basic type of the
cable, the maximum allowed JTAG frequency of the cable and an optional
option string.

For FTDI devices the option string contains the USB vendor ID (VID), USB
product ID (PID), the USB device description string, the FTDI channel of the
JTAG interface and eventual commands for setting other pins beside the JTAG
pins. e.g. to switch on some buffers. If the JTAG device uses a FTDI default
VID/PID, the USB device description string is important to destinguish your
JTAG device from other eventual connected FTDI devices with the same VID/PID
