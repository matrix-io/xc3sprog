This program should run without installation. For accessing USB cables, libusb0
is required as runtime dynamic linked libray.

To compile, you need CMAKE, the static libftdi library and usb.h. 

$ mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make

To crosscompile for Win32 with mingw:

$ mkdir build-win32; cd build-win32; 
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-mingw32.cmake ..

Get a description with 

$ ./xc3sprog -h

This will also list the supported cables.

Get a chain description:

$ ./xcs3prog -j

Device descrption is searched in the file pointed to by the XCDB environment 
variable, or when not found the built-in list is used

Test the chain integrity

$ ./xc3sprog -T -j

Here "-j" stops xc3sprog from entering the program/verify/read the part. If
things go wrong, an endless loop is entered to facilitate hardware degugging
with the scope.
Stop with ^C.

The Platform Flash PROM of the Xilinx Spartan3 Starter Kit can be programmed
by specifying it's location in the JTAG chain. Example command line below.

$ ./xc3sprog -c pp -p 1 <bitfile.bit>

Program the flash of an XC3S50AN by loading the bscan_spi bitfile
first. Aassume the XC3S50AN as single part in the jtag chain

$ ./xc3sprog  ../bscan_spi/xc3s50an.bit

Now program the flash

$ ./xc3sprog -I <your_bitfile.bit>

Verify the flash content against a file

$ ./xc3sprog -I -C <your_bitfile.bit>

You can readout XCF/ISF flash and CPLD

ISF flash probably mean Incircuit Serial Flash, as internal to XC3SAN or 
external connected to XC3SA/XC3SA or XC6S

First load an appropriate bitfile. Some bitfiles are in bscan_spi. Otherwise
use the appropriate HDL file from bscan_spi and a fitting UCF file to create
a ISE Project and run the Xilinx tools to generate the bitfile.

Load the bitfile, like

$ ./xc3sprog bscan_spi/xc6s_cs324.ucf

After loading the ISF Bitfile, you can now talk to the ISF Flash. When 
writing to the ISF, at the end the FPGA tries to reconfigure from flash
and the ISF Bitfile is lost.

$ ./xc3sprog -r (-I) <file to store>

xc3sprog handles XC3, XCF0x and XC95xxxXx. XC4 should work but is untested.

There is also a utility program included that parses and prints the header
of a Xilinx .bit file.

$ ./bitparse echo_out.bit

Jedecfiles for CPLD programming can be parsed with

$ ./jedecparse <jedecfile.jed>

When using a FT2232D|L programmer, speed is noticely enhance with a USB-2.0 
Hub between the adapter and the PC. Some effort has been made to concatenate 
as many JTAG actions as possible.

Example fallback multi boot setup on XC6S

Load intermediate BSCAN_SPI bitfile
$ ./xc3sprog -I <package specific bscan_spi bitfile>

Eventually erase (not really needed)
$ ./xc3sprog -I -e

Prepare the Multiboot header from the Template. Adapt GENERAL2 and GENERAL4 for
your setup. Here a 32 MiBit Flash and a XC6SLX45 is used. The Bitstream length
is about 1484404 = 0x16a674 bytes, so with placing the golden image at 0x10000 
the golden image ends at 0x17a674 and with placing the normal image at 0x190000,
there should be enough spacing between both. Double check that GENERAL2 and 
GENERAL4 match the offsets.

Write the header
$ ./xc3sprog -I<boot_header_only_SPI_x1.hex> 

Write golden image
$ ./xc3sprog -I <golden image>:w:0x10000
 
Write normal image
$ ./xc3sprog -I <normal image>:w:0x190000

Reboot
$ ./xc3sprog -R

All all in one
$ ./xc3sprog -R -I<boot_header_only_SPI_x1.hex> <golden image>:w:0x10000 \
   <normal image>:w:0x190000
